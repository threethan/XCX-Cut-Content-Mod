By threethan#6592 and abarax#6799

Check out [Abarax's blog](https://recedingrust.wordpress.com/) for more info on regional differences and cut content. (Some didn't make it in to this mod due to balance issues or missing files)

**[Install intructions](INSTALL.md)**

## Restored Skells
Restored skells can be crafted at the AM terminal, like normal lv60 skells
All restored skells are level 60, but use alternate models, stats, and overdrive types to the existing skells
Recipies for these skells must be obtained by defeating certain tyrants. The drop chance is 100%, but you must get a gold chest, so get your treasure sensors ready!
*(The blueprint will replace weapon drops, but can only be obtained once. All subsequent kills will drop weapons, as usual)*

**Skell name / Enemy that drops it's blueprint**
- Formula Sengoku / [Stola the Unchained](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/eKlVsEFo)
- Urban Daemon / [Chantai the Insect Maiden](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/peKVDbOU3)
- Inferno Dragoon / [Enhanced Attack Seidr](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/euuRjcxL) (drops from shoulder appendage)
- Verus Cobra / [Armored Cruiser Seidr](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/edmUZDfB) (drops from shoulder appendage)
- Lailah Saiun / [Sharnaak the Technician](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/erAr5dOd)
- Amsdaius Spartan / [Dada'an, The Strongest Prone](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/e7YRAZ2r)
- Mastema Doom / [Gradivus, the Headless Emperor](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/eWIdRvhw)

## Restored Multiguns
Normally, only the Delta Bliss is obtainable, but there exists a whole line of multiguns
- The delta bliss and lower tiers can be bought in the shop under 'Psycho Launchers' section. (They replace the "Sabotuers" which aren't very good and are still dropped by enemies. All are made by the AM Factory 1.21, and as such will not show up until it is unlocked.)
- The Cosmic Bliss (second highest tier) can be dropped by [Chantai the Insect Maiden](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/peKVDbOU3) (50% chance instead of the Signature Glaive)
- The Nebulan Bliss (highest tier) can be dropped by [Sharnaak the Technician](https://frontiernav.jahed.dev/explore/xenoblade-chronicles-x/visualisations/maps/entities/erAr5dOd) (50% chance instead of the Signature Glaive)

## Restored Arts *(file version only!)*
Two arts were cut from the game. They still have properties and voice lines, but no animation data. I've done my best to restore them with what is still in the files.
If you have already met the required class level, the art will unlock automatically.
Some recruitable characters have been given these arts, but will also need to unlock them.
- Air Slash (Knife) - Deal ether damage, and inflict physical resistance down - Unlocks at Psycorrupter 10 - Can inflict Phys.Res.Down lv6
- Full Burst (Assault Rifle) - Deals a large amount of weapon damage - Unlocks at Duelist 10 - Has no special effects, but deals a very large amount of damage for a non-tp art

## Restored Missions
There were many squad missions that were cut. I have restored a select few that were interesting or challenging as singleplayer missions.
Missions include high level enemies, you might want to focus on accuracy using night vision augments.
Many of the missions are very difficult, so make sure to max-out your character first, and try taking on powerful tyrants without your skell.
I can't change the order of the missions, so they are *not* ordered by difficulty!

**Time Attack Missions**
- Dominating Twins - A few rounds of mechanoid enemies, ending with two unique xe-dom enemies
- Skell Showdown - A many round skell-vs-skell battle, with a lurking Xern that powers up over time (the Xern doesn't need to be killed, but might kill you if you let it live!)
- Twin Dolls of Combat - A rematch against the NeilNail enemies, with a much higher drop rate for the mask items
- The Mourning Giant - A millesaur accompanied by some terebra
- Cauldros's Finest - A fight against powerful enemies. Beware the drop!

Some enemies were intended to have time attacks, but the missions were removed and unrestorable. Instead, I made new missions for each of them.

**New Time Attack Missions**
- The Ganglion Goliath - Refight against the Zu Pharg, now lv100 (skells allowed & recommended)
- Skell of the Abyss - Refight against Almandal, now lv60
- Chimeric abomination - Refight against the final boss, very difficult!

**Support Missions**
- Ibra Ravine Royale - 200 reward tickets, 60000 miranium, skells allowed
- M'gando Climb Clash - 200 reward tickets, 120BP, no skells
- Divine Roost Rumble - 250 reward tickets, no skells

## Restored Music
- The track 'In the Forest' now plays when fighting Pharsis, the everqueen, as well a few mission exclusive enemies. (A remix is used when fighting Ygg. Zero, but the original is unused)
- A few enemies have unique themes, but instead play an instrumental of 'Uncontrollable' during time trials. The unique themes have been given to the time trial versions of these enemies.
